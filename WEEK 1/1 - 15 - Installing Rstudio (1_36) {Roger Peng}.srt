00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,740
In this video, I'm going to talk about how
to install RStudio for the Mac.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,028
It's a very simple process and only
involves just a few steps.

4
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:12,530
The one thing I'll say though is that you

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,250
must have R already installed before you
can install RStudio.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,187
So, once you've installed R already.

7
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,351
You can go to the RStudio website, which
is Rstudio.com.

8
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:25,929
[SOUND].

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,349
And you can see down here on the lower
left, there's

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,100
a green button that that directs you to
kind of download RStudio.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,690
So, here there's two versions of RStudio,
studio that you can download.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,951
One is for the desktop and one is for the
server down here.

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:41,635
Now you, we're not going to be talking
about the server version at all here

14
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:45,263
so, you just want to download the desktop
version, so that's this button right here.

15
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:47,600
So the website should detect automatically
what

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,652
type of operating system your running, so

17
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:53,590
here I'm running a Mac, and so it
recommends this Mac OS X version.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,544
So, I'm just going to download that right
now.

19
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:58,262
And, you'll see the download meter go.

20
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,849

21
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:04,771
Once that's finished downloading you go to
the Downloads folder, and it should be

22
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:08,240
the most left thing here so we're just
going to click on it to install it.

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,570
And then just like any other Mac
application, all you have

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,020
to do to install is drag it into the
Applications folder.

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,970
So, I'm going to do that right now.

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,680
And it's already done.

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,712
So, I can just go into the Applications
folder here and find RStudio.

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,182
Double-click on it [SOUND].

29
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:31,130
I'll say yes, I want to open this
application.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,420
And there you go.

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,340
You're running RStudio.
