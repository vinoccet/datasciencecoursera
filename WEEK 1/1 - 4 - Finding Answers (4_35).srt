1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,140
This is a brief follow-up video to getting
help and it's about finding answers.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,620
The reason why there are two videos about
this

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,070
is because it's such a critical skill in
data science.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,230
So you can see one of the three
fundamental sort of,

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,210
skills you see in the Venn diagram here is
Hacking Skills.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,710
And the reason why it's one of the

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,210
three fundamental skill is because almost
of none

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,870
of the knowledge that you will need is

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,680
already sort of set in standardized text
books.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,160
It's often scattered in a bunch of
different places and you have to be

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,940
able to sort of synthesize it or find the
information that you need about.

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,605
Whether it's about which data set you need
to be using, or the statistical analysis

13
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:40,330
you need to be doing, or the R Package
that you need to be using.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,590
All of this is sort of scattered around,
and you have to be willing

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,090
to do a little bit of hard work and elbow
grease to find it yourself.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,570
Obviously we'll tell you as much as we can

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,770
in lectures, but we're necessarily limited
by the amount of

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,410
time that we can lecture every week, and
so

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,690
it's important to be able to find that
information yourself.

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,790
So key, some key characteristics packers
are that

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,470
they're willing to go out and find the
answers

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,450
on their own even if it takes a little bit
of time or a little bit of effort.

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,490
They're knowledgeable about where to find
those answers

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,070
whether its Google, or stack over glow, or
cat.

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,160
Cross validated or a message fo history of
mailing lists.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,340
They're unintimidated by new data types or
packages.

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,930
It's very common as a data scientist to be
thrown a new kind of

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,110
data or a new kind of Our package that you
need to learn very quickly

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,500
to be able to analyze the data to being
unintimidated by that is important

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,230
and then being unafraid to say that you
don't know the answer to a question.

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,350
And so a key characteristic I would say
the way

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,440
to summarize it up is being alive but
relentless here.

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,020
Going after the answer and you just trying
to

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,210
find it But you're very polite while doing
it.

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,320
And so Google knows this too.

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,360
In their hiring practices they're looking
for these sort of characteristics.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,770
The kind of people that will go after
these sorts of

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,490
things as it's described in this article,
I'm linked to here.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,047
[SOUND] So an important question is where

40
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,500
to look for, for different types of
questions.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,180
So for our programming you might want to
go

42
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,420
straight to the the archive of the class
forums.

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,970
Where the class you're taking will focus
on very specific questions or functions.

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,550
And there'll be a large group of
interested people.

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,190
You could read the manual or help files

46
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,550
like I showed you in the getting help
lecture.

47
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,680
You can search on the web.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,400
That's actually one of the best ways to do
it.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,550
You can ask a skilled friend.

50
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,840
That's even better if you've got a person
that you

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,830
know that already is a bit of a data
scientist.

52
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,540
They can often help you out.

53
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,250
And then you can post to the class forums
and try to get your answers.

54
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,620
Remember to be specific with your
questions.

55
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,840
You can also post to forums outside of the
class.

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,500
The R Mailing List or Stackoverflow, if
you have R questions.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,680
For data analysis or statistics type
questions, you want to go to start

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,800
again with the class forums, and then go
to the web or to friends.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,270
And then there's another outside forum
called CrossValidated

60
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,560
where you can ask these types of
questions.

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,370
Brother software you might have to go to
software specific websites.

62
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,420
So forget HUB, they have a lot of
tutorials and

63
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,780
nice information that you can use to get
answers there.

64
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,410
[SOUND] So an important point to know is
that Googling

65
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,590
data science questions isn't always the
easiest thing in the world.

66
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,340
So, the best place to start with if you

67
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,810
have a pretty general question is often in
the forums.

68
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,090
And if people can direct you to where you
should be searching outside of the forums.

69
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,430
Keep in mind that Stackoverflow with the
tag R

70
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,170
is a really good place to get information
about R.

71
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,810
And, so, you have to use this tag because
if you just use

72
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,300
the letter R, it obviously is, sometimes,
a little bit hard to search for.

73
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:36,918
You can also try the R mailing list

74
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:40,270
for software questions or CrossValidated
for more general questions.

75
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,250
Usually what I've found is that if I'm
going

76
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,190
to work in Google, searching Google, I use
usually type

77
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,080
something like the data type and then data
analysis or

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,300
I type the data type and then the R
package.

79
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,340
I found that data type R package often
works a

80
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,680
little bit better than data type, data
analysis when Googling things.

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,530
Another thing to keep in mind is that data

82
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,340
analysis or data science is often called
something different depending

83
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,280
on what kind of data you are looking at,

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,010
so for example medical data it might be
called biostatistics.

85
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,880
For data from the web it might be data
science.

86
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,880
For data in computer vision it might be
machine learning

87
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,260
or natural language processing for data
from text and so on.

88
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,980
So, knowing what the right word to Google
is, is often half the battle.

89
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,530
And so, you can often find that out by
posting to forums and

90
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,880
people will let you know what the right
word to be googling is.

91
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,780
[SOUND] Again the credits for this go to
Roger's Getting Help Video.

92
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,230
And it was inspired by Eric Raymond's How
to Ask Questions the Right Way.
