1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,205
This is the first in a series of overview
lectures that

2
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:05,725
tell'll you about the other courses in the
Data Science course track.

3
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:08,170
I'm going to start off with R programming,
which is another

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,660
one of the most fundamental classes in our
Data Science track.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,180
R is the language that we're going to be
using for most of the data

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,518
analysis and data science that we're going
to be doing on the computer science end.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,030
And so R will tell you, the R programming
class will tell you a

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,040
little bit about data types, about
sub-setting

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,090
data, reading and writing it from files.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,750
How to write functions, to do things to
that data, how

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,990
to debug them and then a little bit about
simulation and optimization.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,300
So now I'm just going to show you a couple
of examples

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,030
of the sorts of things that you'll learn
in that class.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,060
So for example you'll learn about the

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,220
readLines function for reading text from a
file.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,780
So in this case what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,040
reading lines actually from the website of

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,120
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
So this is the website right there.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,370
And so what we do is we go to that website
and then

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,790
we use the readLine func, readLines
function to read the text from that site.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,950
And then we look at that text and you can
actually see the HTML code,

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,350
and it's actually been sucked into R that
you can then use to analyze the website.

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,240
Another thing that you'll be learning
about is how

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,030
to figure out when there's something wrong
with your function.

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,120
So, you'll be writing lots of functions in
this class.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,060
And so, one thing that you want to know

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,840
is when they aren't working, why aren't
they working?

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,940
And so this is a slide that comes from one
of those about

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,700
how do you figure out, what were you
expecting, and what did you get?

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,310
And how do you reproduce the problems so

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,140
that you can figure out how that function
works?

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,620
Well you'll be leaning things like more
detailed functions.

34
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,538
So, for example, this is the lapply
function.

35
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:44,988
And so the lapply function takes a
particular kind of argument.

36
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:47,920
And a list in this case, and applies a
function to

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,700
all the elements of that list and returns
something back to you.

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,970
And so, this is interesting because it's
one of the many examples where

39
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,610
the actual, sort of, analysis is actually
being done internally in C code.

40
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,960
But you don't actually have to access to
that.

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,110
You can actually just use the R function.

42
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,760
So this will cover everything from sort of

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,700
the basics, to more complicated functions
like lapply.

44
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,250
And set you up very nicely for the rest of
the course sequence.
