1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,860
Reproducible research is another one of or
more unique courses.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,000
So reproducible research is concerned with
creating code

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,510
and documents that will completely
reproduce all of the

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,900
analysis that you've done in a transparent
way

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,390
so that you can communicate that to other
people.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,590
It's one of the most fundamental
components of being a data scientist.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,820
But it's often glossed over as a sort of

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,100
a side component of many other programs of
data science.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,030
So we're going to talk about in the

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,300
reproducible research course, the
structure of a data

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,590
analysis, how do you set it up, how do you
organize it and put it together.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,010
We're going to talk about some of the
components of reproducible

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,060
research in terms of programming which
include Markdown, LaTex, R Markdown.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,510
And then we're going to talk a little bit
about a unique idea called evidence-based

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,410
data analysis, doing data analysis based
on

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,476
what's best practices in the field right
now.

17
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:52,708
And then ways that you can publish your

18
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:58,276
data outside of your own organization,
things like RPubs.

19
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,334
So for example, we're going to talk about
the steps

20
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,860
in a data analysis or in a data science
problem.

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,510
And so, you have to go all the way from
defining the questions

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,190
to creating sort of reproducible code that
you can share with other people.

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,610
And so, some of these steps are covered by
different parts of

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,660
the class, and so reproducible research
synthesizes where those parts go together.

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,860
We'll also talk about which files are
components of a data analysis.

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,840
Everything from the sort of a raw data to
the

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,430
exploratory figures to sort the final
analysis that you'll be performing.
