1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,640
This is the Getting and Cleaning Data
course overview.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,140
This is actually one of the more unique
classes in our data science track, but

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,030
I think its sort of one of the

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,600
most fundamental components of being a
data scientist.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,400
Which is being able to go out and get

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,890
data from whatever source it's in and
whatever form

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,900
it's in, and turning it into a clean
processed

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,990
data set, that then you can use to answer
questions.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,790
So in this class, we'll be talking about

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,750
raw versus tidy data, how to download
files.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,810
Reading in data from a very large number
of

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,510
different sources, merging it together,
reshaping it, summarizing it,

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,820
and then finding some data resources that
you can

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,850
use to augment the data that you already
have.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,550
So here are a couple of different things
that you might learn about.

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,220
So, for example, how to connect to a MySQL
database, a MySQL database, from R.

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,950
So this is actually using an R package to
go to R MySQL,

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,296
and you'll be able to connect the
databases and read data from that.

19
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:55,750
Another idea would be sort of merging data
together.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,470
So you take different components of a data
sets.

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,880
So there might be one cloud that contains
reviews and one cloud that

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,790
ca, contains solutions, say from a peer

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,210
assessment, and you want to combine them
together.

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,520
And so, you can use commands in R to merge
those data sets together.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,840
And then, talking about, sort of, raw
versus processed data.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,920
So talking about, what are the data that
come to you in their

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,690
rawest possible form, the original source
of the data versus the processed data.

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,120
The data that's ready for analysis, ready
to be

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,330
used by people that has happened after
you've merged

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,830
it, and sort, subsetted it, and
transformed it into

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,930
the nice tidy data set that people can
use.

32
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,080
So that's getting data.
