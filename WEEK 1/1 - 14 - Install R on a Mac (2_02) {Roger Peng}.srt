00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,900
In this video, I'm going to to briefly
show how you can install R on the Mac.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,110
It's a very simple process.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,960
You just have to, it only takes a few
steps.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,200
So the first thing you need to do is open
your

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,620
web browser, and go to cran, says the
comprehensive R archive network.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,520
So you can just type in cran here, [SOUND]

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,730
and you'll see that, [COUGH] there are a
number of options for you to

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,820
download here for different platforms, and
so

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,220
we're going to download the Mac platform
here.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,750
So we go to download R for the Mac.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,460
And you see that the latest version here,
is version 3.0.3.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,720
You want to download this package file
here, so just click on

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,710
this, and you'll see that the download
meter will start going.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,510
And it might take a few minutes depending
on the speed of your internet connection.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,693
So just be patient.

16
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:52,570

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,860

having read it of course.

28
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,100
And then, you can just click install here,
and

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,800
you might have to type in your
administrator password.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,075
