00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,256
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:08,320
I just wanted to briefly describe how to
install R for a Windows machine.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,430
So the first thing you need to do is

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,900
load, launch your web browser, so I'll do
that here.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,480
I'm using Chrome but it doesn't really
matter.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,880
And you need to go to the Comprehensive R
Archive

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,050
Network, or CRAN, so I'll just type that
in here.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,780
And

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,190
you'll see that there is a, at the top

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,560
there's three options, there's Linux a Mac
and Windows.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,920
So you can go to the Mac version here,

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,820
and you want to go click on the base link
here.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,010
And very top you'll see download R 3.0.3
for Windows and that's

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,430
exactly what you want so you can just
click on this link.

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,960
And the download will start, and so,
depending on how

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,340
fast your internet connection is, this
might take a few minutes.

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,890
Okay, so the download's finished.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,960
I'm going to click on this.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,810
And you'll probably have to click on Yes
for this.

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,600
And so, you can choose your language here.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,542
There are a number of choices in terms of
the translations that you can choose from.

22
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,362
So I'm going to choose English because
that's my language.

23
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:05,360
And then you can just click through the

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,280
installer, it'll kind of walk you through
the various steps.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,710
And so we'll do that right now just to see
what the options are.

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,380
So you click on Next.

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,730
You have to agree to the license, which is
the gener, the GNU General Public License.

28
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,260
So feel free to read it and then click on
Next.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,210
Then usually the default installation
directory is fine.

30
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,112
So I'm going to go through this.

31
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:27,280
The Use the Default User Installation is
fine.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,958
There are other kind of installation
setups that you can choose from.

33
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,686
If you know you only, you have a 32 bit
machine

34
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:36,930
it maybe an older machine you may, you can
click on that.

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,810
By default it will install both versions
so

36
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,190
you don't have to really worry about that.

37
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,670
So just click through Next on this one.

38
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,815
And can you choose, but it's just going to
take all

39
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,990
the defaults or you can try to customize
the start up.

40
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,010
I'm going to customize the start up just
so you can see what the options are here.

41
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,675
So this option here shows you whether,
asks

42
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:57,290
you whether you want an MDI, or SDI
interface.

43
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,460
So what that means is basically do you
want R

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,660
to kind of run in one big window with kind
of

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,370
different sub windows within inside of a
big window, or

46
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,070
you want it to run in kind of like
separate windows.

47
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,140
I prefer to use the SDI mode where the, so
the console will be

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,250
in one window and the kind of graphics
window will be a separate window.

49
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,870
I just kind of, I feel like a, I like

50
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,320
that a little bit better, it's easier to
work with.

51
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,590
So I'm going to click on the SDI option.

52
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,360
And then you can choose how you want to
look at your help files.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,200
So the HTML Help is, is a little bit
nicer, it's prettier to read.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,590
And the Plain Text Help is well it's just
plain text.

55
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,990
So maybe I'll just click on Plain Text
just to be different.

56
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,150
And then you can choose whether you want
Standard or Internet2 internet access.

57
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,049
This, generally speaking, you should not
mess with, so you just click on Next.

58
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,780
You can create a shortcut in the Startup

59
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,550
menu, Start menu so it's usually a good
idea.

60
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,370
And you can usually choose the defaults
here in your terms of creating a

61
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,360
desktop icon unless your desktop is very

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,420
cluttered and want to you know, avoid
that.

63
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,250
So these are, these defaults are fine, so
I'll click on Next.

64
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,510
And then it'll start installing the files
on your computer.

65
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,770
So now it's done.

66
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,540
If we can just click on Finish here.

67
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,670
And, and you've now installed R on your
computer.

68
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,130
And so I'll just close this browser here.

69
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,050
And I see you've got, I've got a

70
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,900
desktop icon here, so I'll just
double-click on that.

71
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,570
And there we are, we're running R.
