00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,340
This is an overview of Building Data
Products, which is a

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,890
sort of unique class that talks about,
what do you do

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,750
with the data analysis or the R functions
that you've created;

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,870
once you've built them, and you want to
share them with somebody else.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,800
So, we'll be talking about things like R
packages,

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,990
how you build them, develop them and share
them.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,660
This is one of the best ways to get your
name out there as a data scientist.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,950
One of the main ways that people decide
about people to hire or

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,690
who to go after is whether they

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,300
built something that those people use
themselves.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,680
And so, R package is the best way to get
your name out in that way.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,180
We'll also talk about how to make
interactive graphics with things like

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,300
rCharts and how to make interactive apps
with things like Slidify and Shiny.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,430
So, R packages you can think of it

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,350
as sort for the engineers; it's, you're
going to build

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,100
an R package to share code that you

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,030
allow other people to use to improve their
analysis.

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,000
So, we're going to teach you how to build
those; we're also going to teach

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
you how to use rCharts; you can think of
this is like for

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,650
marketing, build graphics, interactive
graphics like

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,540
you see in the New York Times

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,890
it'll allow you to share information that
can be interacted with by other people.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,560
And then, finally, Shiny, sort of for end
users, you

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,890
can now use R itself to build web
applications that are

25
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,520
quite intricate and involved and allow you
to just interact with

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,230
data or interact with your analysis in
novel and unique ways.

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,780
So, we'll talk about all of these things
in Building Data Products.
