1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,720
This is a review of exploratory data
analysis,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,010
which is the next course in the course
sequence.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,460
Exploratory data analysis course will
cover the principles of how do

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,370
you create analytic graphics, graphics
that allow you to analyze data.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,540
It'll talk about exploratory graphs, how
you explore the data and get in,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,040
create enough graphs to sort of figure out
the structure of what's going on.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,280
It will talk about the plotting systems in
R.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,830
So it'l talk about base plotting, lattice
plotting

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,280
and then ggplot2 which is a popular newer
platform.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,500
It'll talk about hierarchical clustering,
K-means

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,560
clustering and a little about dimension
reduction.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,120
These are all techniques that you can use
to

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,050
get in and explore data as a first pass.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,830
So, for example, it will talk about how to

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,040
use ggplot2 package to make plots like
this, sort

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,650
of, sort of pretty smooth scatter plots
that allow

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,250
you to like understand the relationship
between different variables.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,860
It will talk about the principles of
analytic graphics,

19
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,360
so what are the principles that you need
to create

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,910
graphics that'll be useful sort of to
figure out what's

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,150
actually going on with the data you'll be
working with.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,170
And then it'll cover things like K-means
clustering.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,280
So the idea of how do we, if we have a
bunch

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,930
of observations of collecting data on
that, how we cluster them into

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,830
relative groups that are similar to each
other as a method of

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,940
exploring the data and figuring out the
structure of what's going on.

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,980
So this is just a couple of the

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,320
ideas that will be covered in exploratory
data analysis.
