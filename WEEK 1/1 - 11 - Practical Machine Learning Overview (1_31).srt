1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,040
This is an overview of practical machine
learning.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,570
There are a large number of machine
learning

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,270
classes out there, and they are often very
good.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,330
So, the focus of this class will be

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,290
primarily on hand-drawn application of
machine learning in R.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,240
So, the idea being that we'll try to focus
on the R packages and the

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,050
ideas that will allow you to actually take

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,800
data and perform machine learning on those
data.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,690
We'll also talk a little bit conceptually
about each of these prediction

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,090
methods work and maybe some of the cases
where there might be trouble.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,990
And then we'll point you to resources
where you can learn more in depth about

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,430
the mathematical details or the really
hardcore

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,470
computational underpaying of these
methodologies if you're interested.

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,070
So the Practical Machine Learning Content.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,420
We'll start with prediction study design,
we'll talk about cross validation.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,282
The caret package for prediction in R,
some pre-processing.

17
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,614
Predicting what the variety of different
ideas like regression and trees.

18
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:56,240
We'll talk about common ideas like
boosting, bagging,

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,670
model blending, and a little bit about
forecasting.

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,300
So here are some examples of things we'll
cover.

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,008
We'll cover basic terms, like what are
true positives and false positives?

22
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:09,750
What are true negatives and false
negatives,

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,730
sensitivity and specificity, those sorts
of things.

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,660
We'll also cover how to deal with
correlated

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,186
predictors by preprocessing out data that
had correlated predictors.

26
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:20,610
When we're moving them from the training
data

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,460
set, and we'll talk a little bit about
boosting.

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,240
So, this is a very more technical machine
learning idea, but can be applied

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,140
quite simply using the functions of a R to
really improve your prediction accuracy.
