1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,050
Welcome to the Johns Hopkins Data Science
Track.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,830
I'm incredibly excited to tell you a
little bit about the track

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,520
and about where you're going to be going
over the next nine months.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,590
My name is Jeff Leek, and I'm a professor

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,510
in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,590
I thought I'd lead off this introductory
video with a

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,900
quote by one of my favorite US Presidents,
Teddy Roosevelt.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,560
He said it's not the critic who counts.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,190
It's not the person who points out how the
person

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,630
who's actually doing things is doing them
wrong or messing up.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,340
It's the person who's actually trying to
get things

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,170
done, even when there are obstacles in the
way.

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,940
And a lot of data science right now is
being able to push through a

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,500
lot of the difficulties that you have when

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,110
you're dealing with either large or messy
data.

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,070
It includes collecting the data clean them
up and then

17
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,000
building new announced techniques that
exploring new information about that data.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,100
And so, all of those steps are a little
bit complicated and sometimes

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,700
it opens you to criticism when you're

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,680
trying to do something new and
interesting.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,540
And so I wanted to lead with a quote that
said it's important to strive

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,490
the valiantly do these sorts of things,

23
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,980
even if you're going to take some
criticism.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,550
So the key challenge in data science is
actually

25
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,360
really nicely summed up in this quote by
Dan Myer.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,360
He says, ask yourselves, what problem you,
have you ever solved, ever, that

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,190
was worth solving, where you knew all of
the given information in advance?

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,210
Where you didn't have a surplus of
information and have to filter some of

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,170
it out, or you didn't have insufficient
information and have to go find some?

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,030
And so, I think that this is a kind of a
critical

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,140
quote because, in data science, this is
usually what is going on.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,340
You're either in a situation where you
really don't have

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,730
enough data to answer the question that
you're interested in, and

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,390
you have to go out and try to search for
it,

35
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,752
find it on the web, or find it in other
places.

36
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,740
Or you're in a situation where you are
overwhelmed with a surplus of data and you

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,280
have to filter out all of the irrelevant

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,470
information to try to narrow in on your
question.

39
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,520
And you'll notice that I said question in
both of those cases.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,965
And I think this goes to the heart of our
philosophy about data science.

41
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:57,570
We're interested in answering questions
with data.

42
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,290
We think the question should come first
and then the data should follow after.

43
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,020
And that actually makes it more
challenging,

44
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,670
because sometimes, you can answer a
question with

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,960
some data but you might not be able to
answer your question with some data.

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,540
So this track is about refocusing on
answering the question

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,930
that you're interested in solving with the
data that you have.

48
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,650
So I thought I'd tell you a little bit
about the instructors

49
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,310
that you'll be hearing from throughout the
course of this, course track.

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,240
So we are all faculty in the Johns Hopkins

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,560
Blumberg School of Public Health in the
Biostatistics Department.

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,450
And you could say that we all

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,090
do data intensive statistics in biology
and medicine.

54
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:39,020
Brian Caffo works on the statistics of
brain, analyzing brain imaging data.

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,180
And I work on the statistics of analyzing
genomics data.

56
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,490
And Roger Peng works on the statistics of
analyzing fine particulate matter.

57
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,970
All of us work on problems where the data

58
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,320
aren't always clean and nice and easy to
handle.

59
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,190
All of us work on problems where the
questions that we want

60
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,610
to answer are complicated and you have to
break them down into parts.

61
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,840
And all of us, sort of, work on questions
where we're very passionate about

62
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,930
trying to get the right answer so that we
can help people in human health.

63
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,990
But the techniques that you're going to be

64
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,010
learning about are not exclusive to
biology and medicine.

65
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,110
That's just one area where there's been a

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,429
recent upsurge in the amount of data
that's available.

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,790
So why data science?

68
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,660
Why should you take this program?

69
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,130
This is a cover of The Economist now.

70
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,610
It's a little bit old I guess ancient
history from a couple of years ago.

71
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,330
But it talks about the data deluge and
it's really true.

72
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,110
Over the last several years data has
become much, much cheaper to collect.

73
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,060
It's much easier to store.

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,750
And there's so many free computing tools
out

75
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,310
there right now, that you can actually do

76
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,790
something with this entire data deluge
that's sort

77
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,600
of assaulting all different areas of
science and business.

78
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,010
So the other thing is that you've probably
heard the term big data.

79
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,140
And so we'll hear a little bit more about
what we think about

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,430
big data throughout the course of

81
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,765
this particular course, the Data
Scientist's Toolbox.

82
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:02,630
But big data is, sort of a new frontier in
the sense that,

83
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,470
we have data in areas that we didn't used
to have that data.

84
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,120
We didn't have access to information about
GPS

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,390
coordinates from cars from everybody in
the entire world.

86
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,590
It wasn't possible to sequence everybody's
genome.

87
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,210
And now that's all possible.

88
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,560
So we have access to this data and it

89
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,820
allows us to answer questions we never
could before.

90
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,700
So, it's an incredibly exciting time, and
you're somebody who can

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,920
get in there and use that data to answer
those questions.

92
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,970
So why statistical data science?

93
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,120
You'll notice that we're, all of your

94
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,930
instructors are biostatistics professors
and so this

95
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,900
will, this data science track will
obviously

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,310
have a little bit of a statistical bend.

97
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,330
I think that that's appropriate given that

98
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,750
statistics is the science of learning from
data.

99
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,340
So, data is very, very, it's very rare
that you'll get a data

100
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,180
set where all of the answers are really
clear, and there's no uncertainty.

101
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,610
In any case where there is uncertainty,

102
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,340
that's where statistics comes and plays a
role.

103
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,820
So, this is a again, a little bit older
New

104
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,590
York Times article now, but it talks about
how the

105
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,170
key word for a lot of graduates to open
the

106
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,390
door for a lot of jobs, is to learn about
statistics.

107
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,830
So why are you lucky?

108
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,390
You're lucky because this moment, right
now, in time is

109
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,700
sort of like the moment that Jeff Bezos
discovered the internet.

110
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,340
He got into building a internet company at
the

111
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,970
time when there was this explosive growth
in internet

112
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,000
usage and it just opened the door for the

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,580
opportunity to build something amazing and
huge and wonderful.

114
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,700
And sort of, that's the right, that's what
the time is right now for data.

115
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,470
It sort of there's an explosive growth of

116
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,690
data in every possible area you can
imagine.

117
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,140
And so it's the opportunity right now to
sort of jump on a rocket and, and

118
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,880
find out something interesting, and, and
sort of

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,070
carry it off into a, a really major
endeavor.

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,620
You're also lucky because tools and
competitions and

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,220
websites have all been developed around
the idea of

122
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,640
helping to learn about data, but also
getting

123
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,320
involved in projects that have super high
profile results.

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,340
So, one example is the Heritage Health
Prize,

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,390
which I'm showing you a picture of here.

126
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,723
The Heritage Health Prize was a $3 million

127
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,310
contest for people who could analyze data
and

128
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,630
come up with a better predictor of who

129
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,520
would be admitted to a hospital in another
year.

130
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,240
So you can see that's a huge amount of
money that's being

131
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,330
invested in these ideas of algorithm

132
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,180
development and data science of
prediction.

133
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,140
So it gives you an exciting opportunity to
get involved in

134
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,720
projects that, sort of, weren't happening
five or ten years ago.

135
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,000
This course track will focus almost
exclusively

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,290
on the use of the R programming language.

137
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,670
And so I thought it was appropriate to
talk

138
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,690
a little bit about why we like R so much.

139
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,290
So we like R obviously, because we all use
it.

140
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,330
But it's also sort of increasingly the

141
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,480
most commonly used language for data
science.

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,970
There are other languages that are also
very useful.

143
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,300
And we won't be talking about them a lot
in this

144
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,100
course but they're obviously good
complements to the R programming language.

145
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,840
Like, Python, in this class we'll be
focusing on R because

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,520
it has a broad range of packages that
allow you to go

147
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,260
from the rawest of raw files, all the way
to interactive reports and

148
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,540
documents and web apps that you can share
with your collaborators.

149
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,330
So, some more reasons why we might use r
is because it's free, it has a

150
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,670
comprehensive set of packages, like I
mentioned, for

151
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,630
all the processes that are involved in
data science.

152
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,070
It has one of the best development

153
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,080
environments of any programming language,
in our studio.

154
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,230
It also has an amazing ecosystem of
developers.

155
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,350
And what I mean by that is there are

156
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,580
a lot of people that are developing our
packages.

157
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,180
And they're also available to get in touch
with

158
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,600
on mailing lists or by email or on stack
overflow.

159
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,130
And so it's really possible to learn about

160
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,780
the cutting edge of packages that are
being developed.

161
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,230
There also very easy to install and play
nicely together, which is a, a feature

162
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,930
that doesn't always happen in a lot of the
languages that are used for data science.

163
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,740
So the next thing I thought I would
mention is, who is a data scientist?

164
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,940
So, we're going to be talking about data
science a lot.

165
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,780
And I thought I'd mention that some people
that I think are data scientists, that

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,300
might not, either label themselves that
way

167
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,180
or have other people label them that way.

168
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,610
So the first is Daryl Morey, who'd the
general

169
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,430
manager of the Houston Rockets basketball
team in the US.

170
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,420
So he uses data to analyze

171
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,510
basketball players and transactions and
making trades.

172
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,090
And so I would consider him to be a data
scientist

173
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,330
Because he's a person who uses data to
answer questions about basketball.

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,040
Another data scientist that you may, or
may not, have heard of, is Hilary Mason.

175
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,130
So, she used to be the Chief, Data

176
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,160
Scientist at Bentley, and now she's at
Accel Partners.

177
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,540
And so, she uses data to answer all sorts
of questions about mining the

178
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,510
web, and understanding that way that
humans

179
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,660
interact with each other through social
media.

180
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,530
So, again she might not label herself a
data

181
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,200
scientist, but I think the way that she
uses data,

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,110
is a evocative of the sort of ideas, that

183
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,190
we would like to convey in this data
sciences track.

184
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,690
If you're taking this course, you probably
know who Daphne Koller is.

185
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,900
She's the CEO of Coursera.

186
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,730
But she's also another person who's using
all the

187
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,830
data they're collecting through Coursera
to better, to improve

188
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,790
the way that we do educational delivery
and educational

189
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,360
assessment at this huge scale that
Coursera is providing.

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,660
And finally, Nate Silver is one of the
most

191
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,730
famous data scientists, or statisticians
in the world today.

192
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,410
So he used a large amount of totally free
public data to make

193
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,440
predictions about who would win elections
in

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,160
the United States, and was remarkably
accurate.

195
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,230
I'm going to finish with him, as the da-,
as the

196
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,260
last data scientist I'm going to
illustrate because it's so amazing that

197
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,280
he could use public free data and create
such an amazing

198
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,039
product that so many people read about,
and are excited about.

199
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,550
So our goal is to teach you about a bunch
different

200
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,830
skills that will be useful for you as a
data scientist.

201
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,140
So, this is a Venn Diagram and some
statisticians and data scientists

202
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,290
don't like Venn Diagrams but I'm going to
get, show you one anyway.

203
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,124
And so, this Venn Diagram has Data Science
at the, sort

204
00:09:55,124 --> 00:10:00,700
of, the center of this Venn diagram that
intersects several different skills.

205
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,990
So, if you look right here there's

206
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,020
data science and it involves three
different components.

207
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,810
There's hacking skills, there's math and

208
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,370
statistics knowledge, and there's
substantive expertise.

209
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,760
And so our data science track will focus a
little bit on each of

210
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,580
these, but it will primarily focus on

211
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,859
math and statistics knowledge and hacking
skills.

212
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,200
And so math and statistics knowledge sort
of speaks for itself.

213
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,970
We're going to teach you a little bit

214
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,390
about math and a little bit about
statistics.

215
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,620
Hacking skills involves two different
components.

216
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,090
One thing is we're going to teach you a
little

217
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,750
bit about computer programming or at least
computer programming

218
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,640
with R, which will allow you to access
data

219
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,755
and play around with it and analyze it,
plot it.

220
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,790
But hacking skills also has another
component to it which

221
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,570
is the ability to go out and answer
questions for yourself.

222
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,760
One key component of a data scientist job
right now is

223
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,370
that most of the answers aren't already
outlined in the textbook.

224
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,890
This is all new stuff that's happening.

225
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,030
So what are the major skills of being a

226
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,050
data scientist is being to go to Google,
and

227
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,160
go to Stack Overflow, and go to one of the
other sites and look up what you need

228
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,340
to learn and figure out what answers you
know

229
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,460
and what answers you don't know, and then
figuring

230
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,210
out how you can use the information you
have

231
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,950
to answer the question that you'd like to
answer.

232
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,000
So another reason obviously is jobs.

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,810
That might be the reason you're taking
this course track.

234
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,660
And so you can see this is a plot of
listings

235
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,710
are for data science jobs over time and of
course it's exploding.

236
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,730
And we'll talk a little bit about why you
shouldn't extrapolate,

237
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,160
necessarily, from your data forever, but
it does suggest that data

238
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,220
science is a hot area that's growing and I
think obviously

239
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,690
we're very excited about it and hope
you're excited about it too.

240
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,070
So this course, Data Scientist's Toolbox,
will

241
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,670
continue with lectures on the following
three things.

242
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,750
First, we're going to introduce you to the
course track.

243
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,980
Then we're going to tell you a little bit
about getting the tools that

244
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,550
you need to get set up and get installed,
hopefully get you over that hump.

245
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,410
And then we're going to give you the

246
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,650
basic background on data science sort of
writ large,

247
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,160
so that you'll be ready to jump into

248
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,280
any of the individual classes and really
take off.

249
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,720
Looking forward to seeing you in the rest
of the class.
