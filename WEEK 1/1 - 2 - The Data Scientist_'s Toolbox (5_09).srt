1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,010
In week two of course, we're going to be

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,560
covering a bunch of software that you're
going

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,080
to install that will constitute the data
scientist's

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,500
toolbox, as we described it for this
course's track.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,650
So the first question you might ask
yourself is, what software do you need?

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,940
Well to know what, software you need, you
have to

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,400
know what exactly a data scientist is
going to do.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,980
So, in this course sequence we're going to
talk

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,110
about all the different components of
being a data scientist.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,140
So we're going to start with defining a
question of interest, and then

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,430
identifying the ideal data set try to
ident, to answer that question.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,720
Determining if that data is even
accessible, a

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,300
lot of times the ideal dataset isn't even
available.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,420
Then ways that you can go out and actually
obtain the data whether it's from a

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,060
database, or from a website, cleaning the
data

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,200
up so that it can be processed and
analyzed.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,210
Performing some sort of exploratory
analysis,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,200
including making plots and clusterings so
you

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,400
can identify patterns that you didn't know
about before hand in the data set.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,150
Performing statistical prediction or
modeling to try to, build a sort of

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,480
an intuition about what's going to happen
in the next sample you might take.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,581
Interpreting your results, challenging
them.

23
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,470
Then synthesizing them and writing them up
in

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,132
reproducible ways that can be shared with
other people.

25
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:12,620
Finally, we're going to talk about
distributing results

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,960
through things like interacting graphics,
also through

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,670
right ups and presentations, and finally
through

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,790
interactive apps built on top of R.

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,680
So the main workhorse of data science in
terms

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,720
of this data science track is the R
programming language.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,310
There are other alternative languages that
are

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,500
also really great for data science, but
we're

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,440
going to be focusing on R, since it's one
of the most widely used languages.

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,880
And it's widely supported by a large group
of developers.

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,060
Who can contribute new packages all the
time

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,160
that can improve and extend the
functionality of R.

37
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,170
We'll be installing this in the second
week of the class.

38
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,700
We'll do most of our coding in RStudio.

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,510
RStudio is an Integrated Development
Environment, an IDE for R.

40
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,720
It's actually one of the best IDE's I
think for

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,200
many other languages as well in terms of
data science.

42
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,000
The R IDE is free as well just like the
language R, and so we

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,120
will be downloading this IDE and setting
it up again the second week of class.

44
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,820
The interface looks something like this.

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,570
And we'll talk a lot more about this in
the

46
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,160
second week and later on in the rest of
the class.

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,700
But you can see here in the top left-hand
corner I've got a file.

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,660
So this is a new .R file that's going to

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,780
contain some code that we're going to be
writing in.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,330
So we can write that code, here in the
file

51
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,750
at the prompt and then down here, you see
a console.

52
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,810
So we'll be entering sort of a commands

53
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,860
at the command line down here in this
console.

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,700
And then over here you can see other

55
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,720
information you might be interested in
looking at.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,830
See plots you recently made, the packages
that you have loaded,

57
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,399
or help files for specific functions that
you might be interested in.

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,240
There are a lot of other really nice
functions that come

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,830
with Rstudio, and we'll be talking about
those more throughout the class.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
The primary type of file that we'll be
interacting with,

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,610
for the most part in this class, is an R
script.

62
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,665
So, an R script is a file with the
extension

63
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:09,830
.R, and so it's just a, actually a text
file.

64
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,830
Except the text file contains bits of R
code, so here it's you can see a comment.

65
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,590
So this isn't actually executed but R you
could include

66
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,480
that so that people can understand what's
happening in the code.

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,800
And then there're things like functions
and so forth which

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,070
we'll be talking about a lot more when
we're coding.

69
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,220
If this seems intimidating to look at this
function right now

70
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,110
you should worry about it when you get
through R programming.

71
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,810
You'll be a wizard and be able to do
things much more complicated than this.

72
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,890
The other thing that we'll be using is R
markdown documents.

73
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,430
So, reproducible research involves
creating documents that can be reproduced.

74
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,470
In other words, they can be rerun and
produce the

75
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,650
exact same numbers that you got when you
did your analysis.

76
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,860
And the primary vehicle for doing that is
through markdown and R markdown.

77
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,352
So this is a file with an extension ,RMD
and

78
00:03:54,352 --> 00:04:00,030
this .RMD file has a very structured
format of text file.

79
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,370
And so we'll talk a lot more about what
that format is later but you

80
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,080
could take this structured file and you
can knit it to html with this button here.

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,600
And you actually create an html file that
will actually be formatted very nicely.

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,630
So for example, what you type in text
looks like this, and

83
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,030
it turns into a nice bulleted list in
HTML, once you knit HTML.

84
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,940
And we'll talk a lot more about how that
file works later in the class.

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,130
We're going to talk about how we are
going to

86
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,430
do distributed version control with Github
and Git.

87
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,550
So, part of this class will be setting

88
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,380
up your Github account and creating a
portfolio, of

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,940
all the different things that you do
throughout the

90
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,605
course track, that then you can share with
employers.

91
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,600
Or you can share and contribute to other
projects, so that

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,870
you can get your name out there in the
data science community.

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,050
We're going to running most of the
commands

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,750
from the shell or from the command line
interface.

95
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,560
So this is a command line interface, it
doesn't look like much right here.

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,710
You can see that there's a prompt up her
in the top left.

97
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,350
And we're going to be entering commands as
text prompts.

98
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,510
And those commands will then execute,
allowing

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,130
the programs that we're going to be
talking about.

100
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,410
So, there's a brief tour of all the tools

101
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,700
that we're going to be using in this
class.
