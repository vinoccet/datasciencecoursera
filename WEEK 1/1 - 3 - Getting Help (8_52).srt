1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,780
This lecture is about getting help.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,000
This lecture applies both to this cla-,
this course

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,180
that you're taking right now, the Data
Scientist Toolbox.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,170
But also to all the other courses you're
going to be taking in the course track.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,850
So, keep in mind that in a standard class
you may have taken in a

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,050
class of 30 or 100 people, you would raise
your hand and ask a question.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,270
And then you'd be able to immediately get
feedback from your instructor.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,430
But in a class like this in a massive
online open

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,575
class there could be up to a 100,000
people taking the class.

10
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:30,310
And what you're going to do instead is
post your questions to the message board.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,620
And then hopefully, your fellow students

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,010
will upload them if they're good
questions.

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,950
And you instructor will try to respond to
as many as possible, but

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,800
probably more often than that your peers
or community TAs will be responding.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,940
And so, there are three of us that are
teaching these nine classes and we

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,850
are going to try to put in as much as we
can to answer your questions.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,340
But obviously, that's a limited resource.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,295
And so relying on your fellow peers and
your community

19
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:56,610
TAs, we found is a great way to get
involved.

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,420
We've also learned that the community
that's built around the

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,200
message boards and the massive online open
courses is amazing.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,400
And it's a, probably the best learning
part of the entire experience.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,300
And so hopefully, you'll get involved and
you'll

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,360
be an active participant in those message
boards.

25
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,240
It's very clear that the fastest answer is
often the one that you find for yourself.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,200
So to try to answer your questions
yourself, you should try to

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,290
look it up on Google or look it up on
Stack Overflow.

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,710
If you ask a question that's very simple
to Google, you'll

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,780
often a get response that says Google it
or read the documentation.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,130
Which is not the easiest way to get the
answer that you're going for.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,250
An important part of being an active
participant

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,750
in a community environment here is to, if

33
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,630
you figure out an answer to a question is
to post it to the message board.

34
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,030
If you're struggling with a particular
part

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,690
or structure or idea or art programming
exercise.

36
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,270
It's almost a sure bet that there's a lot

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,370
of other people that are struggling with
the same thing.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,790
And so, they'll really appreciate it if
you take the time to post

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,980
the message board the way that you figured
out how to solve that problem.

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,240
So, I thought I'd mention just a few
important R functions that will

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,510
help you to find answers for some of the
questions you might have.

42
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,080
So, when you have an R function, we'll
talk a

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,090
little bit more about R more later in the
class.

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,990
You can actually type several different
ways you can

45
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,200
type to get the help file for that
function.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,140
So, one example is that you can type like
this.

47
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,500
You can type ?rnorm and that will tell you

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,850
what the help file is for the function
rnorm.

49
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,690
You can also search like this help.search.

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,020
And if you use help.search, you might not
even

51
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,310
necessarily have to get the function name
exactly right.

52
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,560
It'll still search through, through the
help files and try to find things for you.

53
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,420
And then, if you want to get the arguments
for a function,

54
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,170
you can use the function, you can use,
the, command args, like this.

55
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,800
Args of rnorm and that'll tell you the
function arguments.

56
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,830
These functions are very useful if your
goal is to try

57
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,430
to figure out how r is working for a
particular function.

58
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,410
But it might not be so useful, if you want

59
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,730
to understand the sort of underlying
concepts involved in those functions.

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,220
So another thing is you might want to do
is

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,960
actually look a little bit deeper into the
code.

62
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,450
So if you wanted to do that you can
actually just type the function

63
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,060
name without any brackets and it will

64
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,055
actually reproduce the entire code for
you.

65
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:23,780
And so what you see here if I type rnorm
like this.

66
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,190
Then what I end up getting out on the R
console is actually this right here.

67
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,070
I get out sort of all the code that
corresponds to that function.

68
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,940
You could also see this link here to a

69
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,970
reference card with a lot of helpful R
functions.

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,450
So, an important point that you'll run
into a lot

71
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,980
in this class is how to ask an R question.

72
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,620
And so there are a few different
components

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,550
of it that you should keep in mind.

74
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,100
First is, you will want to outline what
are the steps

75
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,560
that you have executed in order to create
this problem.

76
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,270
So, if you ran three functions in order

77
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,370
you should reproduce what those three
functions are.

78
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,840
And then you should say what you expect
the output to be.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,100
And then what you saw instead.

80
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,860
So I expected it to give me the answer

81
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,720
to this question and instead, it gave me
an error.

82
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,460
And so a really important thing to keep in
mind is that R packages and R and all

83
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,580
of these other tools that we're going to
be

84
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,670
telling you about are going to be evolving
over time.

85
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,730
And so it's really important that you tell

86
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,490
the version of the product that you're
using.

87
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,490
So, the version of the package, the
version of R

88
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,560
that you're using and then what operating
system you're working on.

89
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,420
Whether you're on Mac or Linux or Windows.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,880
When you're asking a data analysis
question, there's a similar

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,450
set of things that you need to re, re,
report.

92
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,660
So first is what is the question you are
trying to answer.

93
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,040
You're saying I'm trying to relate
variable y to variable x.

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,560
And then, what steps or tools do you use
to answer it?

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,100
This may be a combination of R tools and
outside tools and maybe some intuition.

96
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,120
And then, you again, you report what you
expected to see.

97
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,400
I expected to be able to tell the

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,710
relationship between them and what do I
see instead?

99
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,500
I see oh, I don't know, I see some

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,140
crazy scatter plot and I don't know what
that means.

101
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,030
And so important thing to think, keep in
mind here

102
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,410
too is what other solutions you might have
thought about.

103
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,260
So sometimes you run through three or four

104
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,340
different things to try to get the right
answer.

105
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,980
And so, if you're report what you try or
the different things you try, there

106
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,570
when people try to answer your question,
they

107
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,600
can go directly to something you haven't
tried.

108
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,100
So an important point of asking questions
in

109
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
highly massive class like this is to make
sure

110
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,110
that you're very specific in the titles of

111
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,920
the questions that you're using on the
message forum.

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,010
So some examples of bad titles are things
like this.

113
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,640
So you can say, Help!

114
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,750
I can't fit a linear model.

115
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,470
Then you're not exactly giving a lot of
detail as

116
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,440
what exactly your problem is or how it can
be addressed?

117
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,580
So, a better question to ask is, sort of
saying, okay, I

118
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,328
have this function and it's happening in
that version of R 2.15.

119
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:49,980
And here is the error that's being
produced.

120
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,620
It's a seg fault that's being produced.

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,430
And is only being produced when I have a

122
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,250
large data set and here's the software
that I'm using.

123
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,305
I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.3.

124
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,180
And even better question is to use a title
that's a little bit more succinct.

125
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,460
So, here you lead off again, the function
that you're asking about, you

126
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,580
say okay, I'm asking about R 2.15 and
again it's on this operating system.

127
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,370
And then I very succinctly describe seg
fault on large data frame.

128
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,180
So by focusing on the very specific
details, it means people

129
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,110
can jump very quickly to the answers that
you might need.

130
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,340
So there's similar sorts of questions,
specific details you would

131
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,820
want to give when asking questions about
data analysis problems.

132
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,380
So, in general, the more specific you are
the faster your answer will come.

133
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,400
So there's some etiquette that we would
like

134
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,070
to encourage in terms of using these
forums.

135
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,770
Or in, in just using help sites in general
not necessarily the ones in these forums.

136
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,350
So, again, describe the goal that you
have.

137
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,800
What's the question you're trying to
answer?

138
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,840
Be very explicit.

139
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,050
Try to provide the minimum amount of
information.

140
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,300
If you, you provide way to much
information it's very hard for

141
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,580
people to filter through and figure out
what their real problem is.

142
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,320
Being polite never hurt anybody and will
often get your answer more quickly.

143
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,930
And then follow up and post solutions.

144
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,900
So if you post a question and somebody
ends up giving

145
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,600
you the answer on Stack Overflow instead
of on the course website.

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,990
It's the polite thing to do, post that you
found on the course

147
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,460
website so that people can search it and
find that answer as well.

148
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,170
Please, please use the forums rather than
using personal emails.

149
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,570
We are very excited about trying to help
you learn about data science.

150
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,150
But it's very easy to overwhelm the
inboxes of your

151
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,970
instructors or community TAs if you all
start sending emails simultaneously.

152
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,120
When there's a typo in the assignment,
please report it on the

153
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,630
forums and we will address it as fast as
we possibly can.

154
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,970
Some things that you shouldn't necessarily
do are immediately

155
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,180
assume you found a bug in a major program.

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,070
So, saying you found a bug in R and that's
why things aren't working.

157
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,250
Groveling as a substitute for your work is
obviously not a great thing.

158
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,580
So begging other people to do your work
for you.

159
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,030
Please don't post homework questions on
mailing lists or on the course forums.

160
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,760
If you post the questions or the answers
on the forums

161
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,190
it, it sort of takes away from the
experience of everybody else.

162
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,030
Please don't e-mail a lot of different
lists all simultaneously.

163
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,840
Try to figure out what the right mailing
list is and only e-mail that.

164
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,160
And then, you don't want to ask general
data analysis questions on R forums.

165
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,230
Those are often redirected back to
courses.

166
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,680
So try to keep those who are R course
forums, where hopefully there'll

167
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,000
be a big group of interested people all
trying to answer the same questions.

168
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,350
So the transfer of these slides go to

169
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,170
Roger Payne who's another instructor in
the course track.

170
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,600
He has these getting help videos.

171
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,870
That's a link to his video on YouTube and
it was

172
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,090
inspired by Eric Raymond's lecture, How to
ask questions the smart way.
