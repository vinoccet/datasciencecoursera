1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,530
Statistical Inference is going to be a
course that covers many of

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,500
the foundational ideas that are involved

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,410
with extracting generalizable information
from data.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,490
And so, the course will cover things like
basic probability,

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,510
likelihoods common distributions,
confidence intervals,

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,830
hypothesis tests, bootstrapping and power.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,530
These are the sort of fundamental ideas
that you

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,175
often hear coming up when people are
reporting data analysis.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,140
So, for example, we'll talk about sort of
the

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,040
way that you model mathematically coin
flips or proportions.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,360
We'll also talk a little bit about how you
model more continuous

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,670
distributions, things like, with the
normal

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,230
distribution which you've probably heard
about.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,110
As a way to measure sort of the
variability about a large

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,900
number of different things including IQ
and height and things like that.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,030
And then we'll talk about things like
bootstrapping, where you

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,560
actually use the data itself to sort of
create measures of

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,170
variability that you can use to sort of
decide how generalizable

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,380
are the answers that you get from
performing any particular analysis.
