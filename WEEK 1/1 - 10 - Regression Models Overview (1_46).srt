1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,560
One of the most widely used tools for
performing any

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,610
sort of statistical or data science
analysis is a regression model.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,200
So the next course will be covering those
regression models.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,780
Some would say it's just one other form

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,260
of just pre, creating a supervised
predictive function.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,845
But it's a little bit more than that in
that it's, one of the more

7
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:20,760
interpretable and easily used, tools that
you

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,510
can use to sort of explain you analyses.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,380
The people that are outside of the data
science community.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,070
And, as communication is a critical
component of data science,

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,930
that makes regression models a critical
component of the tool box.

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,560
So, this course will cover linear
regression

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,420
and multiple regression, ideas like
confounding which

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,170
we'll see a little bit in this class even,
some prediction using linear models.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,300
Scatterplots smoothing its splines, and
then

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,740
resampling inference, and maybe weighted
regression.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,550
So, this will cover also some ideas
including ideas that you hear

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,980
about often when you read articles about
statistical analyses in the popular press.

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,930
Things like regression to the mean.

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,410
So, why is it that children of tall
parents tend

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,720
to be tall but not as tall as their
parents were?

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,530
So these sorts of fundamental ideas will
be explained in the regression class.

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,890
So we'll also talk a little bit about the
basic regression

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,380
model, there'll be a little bit more
mathematics in this class

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,280
than there are in some of the other
classes and sort

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,360
of deriving and understanding the basic
ideas behind a regression model.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,610
But calculus and the new algebra are not
required.

28
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,600
We've worked hard to make it so that,
basic

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,050
understanding of algebra is sufficient to
follow this class.

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,650
We'll also learn about multivariable
regression analyses so,

31
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,630
sometimes you want to relate one variable
to another

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,800
variable but you want to account for, what
happens

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,660
when you include other variables,
adjusting your analysis.

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,630
You often hear about adjusting the
analysis, and

35
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,150
that will be covered in this class as
well.
